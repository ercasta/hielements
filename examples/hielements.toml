# Hielements Configuration File
#
# This file configures external library plugins for the Hielements interpreter.
# Place this file in your project root (next to your .hie files).

# External Libraries
# Each entry defines a library that can be imported in .hie files.
# 
# Hielements supports two types of plugins:
# 1. External Process Plugins - Standalone programs communicating via JSON-RPC
# 2. WASM Plugins (Experimental) - WebAssembly modules with sandboxed execution
#
# External Process Plugin Format:
#   [libraries]
#   library_name = { executable = "path/to/executable", args = ["arg1", "arg2"] }
#
# WASM Plugin Format (Experimental):
#   [libraries.library_name]
#   type = "wasm"
#   path = "path/to/plugin.wasm"
#   capabilities = { fs = "read", workspace_only = true, env_access = false }
#
# Example external process plugin:
#   [libraries]
#   sample = { executable = "python3", args = ["examples/plugins/sample_plugin.py"] }
#
# Example WASM plugin (experimental - infrastructure in place, execution coming soon):
#   [libraries.wasm_sample]
#   type = "wasm"
#   path = "plugins/sample.wasm"
#   capabilities = { fs = "read", workspace_only = true }
#
# Then in your .hie file:
#   import sample
#   
#   element mycomponent:
#       scope src = sample.simple_selector('src')
#       check sample.file_count_check(src, 100)

[libraries]
# Uncomment the following line to enable the sample Python plugin:
# sample = { executable = "python3", args = ["examples/plugins/sample_plugin.py"] }

# WASM plugins (experimental - will be fully functional in a future release):
# [libraries.wasm_sample]
# type = "wasm"
# path = "plugins/sample.wasm"
# capabilities = { fs = "read", workspace_only = true, env_access = false }
