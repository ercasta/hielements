# Hielements Configuration File
#
# This file configures external library plugins for the Hielements interpreter.
# Place this file in your project root (next to your .hie files).

# External Libraries
# Each entry defines a library that can be imported in .hie files.
# 
# Supports two types of plugins:
#   1. External process plugins (JSON-RPC over stdio)
#   2. WASM plugins (sandboxed, near-native performance)
#
# Format:
#   [libraries]
#   # External process plugin
#   library_name = { executable = "path/to/executable", args = ["arg1", "arg2"] }
#   # or shorthand when no args:
#   library_name = { executable = "path/to/executable" }
#   
#   # WASM plugin (explicit type)
#   library_name = { type = "wasm", path = "path/to/plugin.wasm" }
#   # or inferred from .wasm extension:
#   library_name = { path = "path/to/plugin.wasm" }
#
# Example:
#   [libraries]
#   sample = { executable = "python3", args = ["examples/plugins/sample_plugin.py"] }
#   typescript = { type = "wasm", path = "lib/typescript.wasm" }
#   docker = { path = "lib/docker.wasm" }  # .wasm extension implies type="wasm"
#
# Then in your .hie file:
#   import sample
#   import typescript
#   
#   element mycomponent:
#       scope src = sample.simple_selector('src')
#       check sample.file_count_check(src, 100)

[libraries]
# Uncomment the following line to enable the sample plugin:
# sample = { executable = "python3", args = ["examples/plugins/sample_plugin.py"] }

# WASM plugins (infrastructure ready, runtime integration in progress)
# Note: Configuration is fully functional. Runtime execution via wasmtime is in progress.
# typescript = { type = "wasm", path = "lib/typescript.wasm" }
