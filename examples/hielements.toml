# Hielements Configuration File
#
# This file configures external library plugins for the Hielements interpreter.
# Place this file in your project root (next to your .hie files).

# External Libraries
# Each entry defines a library that can be imported in .hie files.
# 
# Format:
#   [libraries]
#   library_name = { executable = "path/to/executable", args = ["arg1", "arg2"] }
#   wasm_library = { type = "wasm", path = "path/to/library.wasm" }
#
# Examples:

[libraries]
# External process plugin (JSON-RPC over stdio)
# Uncomment the following line to enable the sample plugin:
# sample = { executable = "python3", args = ["examples/plugins/sample_plugin.py"] }

# WASM plugin (sandboxed, portable, high-performance)
# Build first: cd examples/plugins/wasm-sample && cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
# Then uncomment:
# wasm_sample = { type = "wasm", path = "examples/plugins/wasm-sample/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wasm_sample.wasm" }

# Auto-detection based on file extension (.wasm files are automatically detected as WASM)
# wasm_sample = { path = "examples/plugins/wasm-sample/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wasm_sample.wasm" }

# Use in .hie files:
#   import sample          # External process plugin
#   import wasm_sample     # WASM plugin
#   
#   element mycomponent:
#       scope src = sample.simple_selector('src')              # External
#       check wasm_sample.always_pass()                        # WASM
#       check sample.file_count_check(src, 100)                # External
