# Hielements Configuration File
#
# This file configures external library plugins for the Hielements interpreter.
# Place this file in your project root (next to your .hie files).

# External Libraries
# Each entry defines a library that can be imported in .hie files.
# 
# Format:
#   [libraries]
#   library_name = { executable = "path/to/executable", args = ["arg1", "arg2"] }
#
# Example:
#   [libraries]
#   sample = { executable = "python3", args = ["examples/plugins/sample_plugin.py"] }
#
# Then in your .hie file:
#   import sample
#   
#   element mycomponent:
#       scope src = sample.simple_selector('src')
#       check sample.file_count_check(src, 100)

[libraries]
# Uncomment the following line to enable the sample plugin:
# sample = { executable = "python3", args = ["examples/plugins/sample_plugin.py"] }
